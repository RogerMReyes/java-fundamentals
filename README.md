Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hour

Start time: 4:00pm

Finish time: 6:00pm

Actual time needed to complete: 2 hours

Summary: In this lab we explored multiple basic concepts with Java primitives. We explored how the syntax differs from JavaScript and the necessary steps needed to run the created functions in the main method. I pair programmed with Micheal Brunette though the entire lab.
