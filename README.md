Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hour

Start time: 2:00pm

Finish time: 4:30pm

Actual time needed to complete: 2 hours 30 minutes

Summary: In this lab we explored the functionality of arrays and loops. One thing I found interesting was how the double array syntax is structured. 

## Lab 03 Maps, File I/O , and Testing

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hour

Start time: 2:00pm

Finish time: 5:00pm

Actual time needed to complete: 3 hours

Summary: In this lab we took what we learned about Maps and Sets and utilized their unqique properties to produce certain results. We also dove into utilizing a Scanner in order to take in a file as an input in order to utilize the information inside. For the linter file that was created it contains a method that takes in a file as an argument and will tell the user all the lines where they are missing semicolons where they are required.
